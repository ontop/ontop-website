# Research team

Ontop is a project initiated by Diego Calvanese and Mariano Rodriguez-Muro in 2009 in [the KRDB research centre for Knowledge and Data](https://www.inf.unibz.it/krdb/) at [the Free University of Bolzano](https://www.unibz.it/en/faculties/computer-science/).

A decade after, Ontop remains very active, both from a research and a software development point of view.
